# Hello-world
My first ever repository on GitHub! Cant wait to hustle.
I'm a second year grad student speacialising in Computer science. My goal is to get to into one of the ivy leagues and enhance my knowledge. I would love to utilize my skills in coding and design and serve the humanity! 
I'm so excited to get this journey started.
